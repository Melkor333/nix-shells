# Mach Nix

Use a [mach-nix](https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix) to get an environment from a pip `requirements.txt`.

Run the three numbered scripts to get the shell (and are basically what is described on the `mach-nix` README)
- First one just gets `mach-nix` into the path (could also be globally installed)
- Second one effectively installs dependencies from the `pip-requirement.nix.
- Third one activates the env
